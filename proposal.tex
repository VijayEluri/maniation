\section*{Project description}

The goal of this project is to develop a software tool for 3D character
animation, akin to (but simpler than) the applications used in the
production of cinematic special effects.

\subsection*{Core requirements}

The tool developed in this project should take as input a description
of a deformable polygon mesh bound to a skeleton. The skeleton should
contain anatomical constraints, in particular the range of angles each
joint may reach. The tool should calculate correct deformations of the
mesh for a given valid skeletal configuration and render the deformed
mesh to a screen.

In the next step, the tool should detect collisions within the
deformed mesh, and use the laws of classical mechanics to simulate a
rigid body, thus preventing different parts of the mesh from
intersecting. The simulated physical effects in a core implementation
should include collisions (impulse), friction forces, intertial mass
and gravitational forces. Additional information required for this
simulation (e.g. the mass of body attached to each bone of the
skeleton) should be included in the input file. Internal (muscular)
forces of the skeleton may also be specified as input, enabling the
character to move `out of its own strength'. All physical effects
should be simulated on a time-step basis.


\subsection*{Optional extensions}

Extensions to the program aim to take it further in the direction of
tools used by 3D animation artists to create realistic-looking
movements of humans or creatures. Possibilities include an inverse
kinematics solver, or interaction with other objects.


\subsection*{Acceptance criteria}

The program must correctly handle the animation of at least one mesh
resembling a human being. The mesh and skeleton need to include only
the main limbs (fingers, face etc. are considered optional). The
animation is correct if the character never enters an anatomically
impossible pose and does not violate the laws of physics.

Screenshots of several animations produced by the program will be
included in the dissertation. For further evaluation, other students
will be shown animations and asked to answer questions on whether they
believe the animation to be correct by the above definition.

Run-time performance is an optional acceptance criterion of this
project: ideally the program should run fast enough to calculate
animations on the example mesh in real time with fluent concurrent
graphical output, an average present-day PC provided. Such a
performance constraint may, however, require the use of very advanced
algorithms, and is therefore not regarded as part of the core project.


\subsection*{Non-Goals}

The following issues are {\em not} objectives of this project:

\begin{itemize}
\item To achieve realistic graphical results. It is hard to objectively
  measure how realistic an animation looks, and a subjective judgement
  depends on many artistic factors. The graphics should be judged by
  `correctness' only.

\item To create an interactive user interface. The tool requires no user
  input beyond the mesh, skeleton, anatomy and animation files.

\item To achive scientifically accurate calculations. High-quality
  approximations of the differential equations describing the
  mechanics require advanced numerical methods, which are considered
  to be beyond the scope of this project. Simple approximations are
  sufficient provided they do not lead to obviously wrong results.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Resources}

The main body of the program will be written in Java 1.5. This
language is well suited for the purpose because of its widespread
acceptance, good maintainability and the availability of extensive
libraries. The graphical output will be rendered using the Java3D
library.

Development will primarily be undertaken on my own PC, with a
revision-controlled copy on at least one other computer at any time,
and at least weekly backups on Pelican (daily when approaching a
deadline). All required software has been tested on PWF machines; in
the case of a problem with my own PC, project development could
seamlessly continue on the PWF.


\section*{Starting point}

I have some basic prior experience in programming 3D graphics

%% TODO...

Apart from the data binding tool, which serves merely to facilitate
the reading and writing between XML data and Java objects, and the
standard Java runtime libraries, I do not intend to make use of any
external or previously written code. The physics simulation will be
based primarily on my knowledge from Part IA Natural Sciences and
additional reading if necessary. For the collision detection part
of the project, I will search for literature on appropriate algorithms
during the preparation phase.

I would like to create example 3D meshes myself using the Blender
modelling software. I already have a moderate amount of experience
in using this application. I have also done some programming with the
OpenGL libraries in the past; however, this never included deformable
meshes. No additional programming languages will be required.


\section{Timetable}

The project timetable aims to complete long before the final deadline
in order to leave additional time for exam revision. It is divided
into 2-week blocks. The completion of the tasks by the end of each
block constitutes a milestone.
