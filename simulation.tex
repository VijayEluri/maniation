The preparatory work for this project splits into two parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Surveying literature, learning the theoretical background and understanding the existing
    algorithms for my task. The outcome of this preparation is discussed in
    sections~\ref{rigidBodyDynamics} to~\ref{articulatedBodies}.
\item Setting up and learning to use the software environment for development. This is described
    in section~\ref{softwarePreparation}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Rigid body dynamics\label{rigidBodyDynamics}}
On the most theoretical level, a rigid body is a collection of $k$ point masses ($k \ge 3$,
can be infinite) subject to the constraint that the distance between any pair of masses must
remain constant. More conveniently, we can regard a rigid body as an object with a
three-dimensional shape, a non-zero volume and some mass distribution, and assume that it does not
change shape.

At a particular point in time, a rigid body is fully determined by four non-scalar quantities: the
\emph{position} of its centre of mass, its \emph{orientation}, and its \emph{linear} and
\emph{angular velocities}. These values usually change over time. Each of these can be easily
represented as a three-component vector, except for orientation, which is discussed in
section~\ref{quaternions}. By convention a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system is used.

To characterize the body's dynamic behaviour, we also need to know its \emph{inertial mass},
a scalar quantity, and its \emph{moment of inertia}, which is a rank-2 tensor (commonly written
as a $3\times3$ matrix). While the mass stays constant, the moment of inertia may
depend on the body's orientation~-- it is, however, constant when expressed with respect to the
body's \emph{principal axes}~\cite{Feynman:63,Goldstein:80}.

Angular velocity appears to be a straightforward way of describing the body's rotation: the
direction of the vector gives the axis of rotation, while its magnitude is the rate of rotation
(most commonly given in radians per second). Unfortunately, in an asymmetric body, the angular
velocity may vary over time even if there are no external influences on the body, due to an effect
known as \emph{free precession} or \emph{Poinsot motion}~\cite{Goldstein:80,Julian:notes}. It is
therefore more convenient to use \emph{angular momentum} instead, which is conserved in the
absence of torques.

& \emph{Linear} & \emph{Angular} \\\hline

\end{tabular}}
\caption{Summary of the physical quantities describing a rigid body\label{rigidBodySummary}}
\end{table}

Forces and torques acting on a body may change the momenta of a body as described in
table~\ref{rigidBodySummary}. A force \ve{F} may be applied to any point $\ve{r}'$ of
a body. We can treat this as if the force had been applied to the centre of mass \ve{r}, and add
an additional torque given by $\ve{\tau} = (\ve{r}' - \ve{r})\times\ve{F}$. If multiple
forces and torques are applied, all forces (applied to the centre of mass) may be added into
a single vector, and similarly all torques may be added.

To solve the differential equations of motion, forces are integrated over time to find linear
momentum, and torques are integrated to find angular momentum. From each of these we calculate
linear and angular velocities, which are in turn integrated to find the position and orientation
over the course of time. It is important that we integrate over torques (and not angular
accelerations), otherwise the simulation will not correctly conserve angular momentum.

\section{Solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\label{solvingODEs}}

Undergraduate mathematics courses cover various methods for solving ODEs analytically.
These work well for simple systems and deliver
an exact solution. For example, if a constant force is applied to a body, its displacement is a
quadratic (parabolic) function of time; if the force is negatively proportional to the
displacement, we observe simple harmonic oscillation. Unfortunately, when systems become
only slightly more complicated, the equations become intractable~-- even a simple pendulum
falls in this category. General solutions can then only be approximated numerically.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics{figures/euler}}
\caption{Demonstration of Euler's method for solving the ODE of simple harmonic oscillation.
    The broad grey line represents the exact solution. At each time step, the method takes the
    derivative (gradient) of the function and uses it to extrapolate linearly.\label{eulersMethod}}
\end{figure}

The general scheme for numerical ODE solvers is to take the value of a function $f(t')$ and its
derivative $\frac{\diff f}{\diff t}(t')$ at some point in time $t'$. From these the algorithm
extrapolates what the value of the function is expected to be some time step $h$ later. The
simplest, most frequently-quoted and worst algorithm for this purpose is Euler's method,
\begin{equation}
f(t'+h) = f(t') + h\frac{\diff f}{\diff t}(t'),
\end{equation}
which performs linear extrapolation. Figure~\ref{eulersMethod} illustrates its operation and the
errors introduced in the solution.

A popular and robust alternative is given by the \emph{Runge-Kutta} family of ODE solvers, which
evaluate $\frac{\diff f}{\diff t}$ at different times and use these values to fit a polynomial
curve to the exact solution over the range of one time step. For example, fourth-order Runge-Kutta
(RK4)~\cite{NRinC} uses four values of the derivative to fit a fourth-order polynomial~-- contrast
this to the first-order polynomial (linear function) used by Euler's method. This amounts to using
the first five terms of the Taylor expansion of the exact solution, including the $h^4$ term, so
we expect the error in each time step to be $O(h^5)$~-- a minute error even if $h$ is only
moderately small. The step size can be much longer than in Euler's method while achieving the same
accuracy, which makes Runge-Kutta significantly more efficient.

Further improvements can be made by adapting the step size $h$ to the situation. In this project
I chose to use the embedded Cash-Karp/Runge-Kutta method described in~\cite{NRinC}, which uses
six evaluations of the derivative to calculate both a fourth-order and a fifth-order
extrapolation. If the difference between them is small, the total error is likely to be small,
and the next step taken will be longer. If the difference lies above a threshold, the current
time step is discarded and retried with a smaller $h$. Thus the ODE solver can rapidly skip over
periods in which there is little happening, without sacrificing accuracy in moments of sudden
change.
