The first three chapters explain in detail how the simulation application was developed. I now
turn to its evaluation and explain how I showed that the program works as required.

\section{Testing strategy\label{testingStrategy}}

An application as large as the one developed in this project is almost impossible to get right
entirely by advance planning. Although I took much care during the preparation and implementation,
I anticipated that testing and debugging would be necessary.

As mentioned in section~\ref{engineering}, I prototyped most numerical algorithms in
\textsl{Octave} which allowed rapid interpretation of results through its plotting facilities,
and hence a rapid edit--test--debug cycle. For each major algorithmic part of the project
I modelled a physical system which placed a particular emphasis on one part of the simulation,
thus allowing me to test and debug each feature before working on the next feature:
\begin{itemize}
\item a gyroscope (section~\ref{evalGyroscope}) to test rigid body dynamics,
\item a double pendulum to test articulated bodies/constraints,
\item Newton's cradle (section~\ref{evalCollisions}) to test colliding contact handling,
\item a simulation of boxes falling onto a table to test resting contact handling.
\end{itemize}

I developed the \textsl{Java} version of each feature only after it was working to satisfaction in
the \textsl{Octave} prototype. The \textsl{Java} implementation usually introduced new bugs, which
I could locate by implementing the same test cases in \textsl{Java}, and using step-by-step
comparison with the \textsl{Octave} computation. This testing and debugging strategy turned out
to be fruitful and effective.


\section{Quantitative evaluation}

I performed several quantitative tests on the program by simulating simple mechanical systems and
comparing their numerical outcome to the physical predictions.

\subsection{Gyroscope simulation\label{evalGyroscope}}
The first set of tests simulates a \emph{gyroscope} (figure~\ref{gyroscope}), which was also used
as a general test case (section~\ref{testingStrategy}). A gyroscope consists of a single rotating
rigid body and a `nail' constraint (appendix~\ref{constrNail}) holding one end of its axis in
place. In a gravitational field the gyroscope exhibits a precession movement. Although this
behaviour seems counter-intuitive at first, it can be characterized analytically~\cite{Julian:notes}.
There are not many interesting systems of rigid bodies which have an exact solution, so a
gyroscope is a good choice for quantitative evaluation.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics{figures/gyroscope}}
\caption{Schematic drawing of a gyroscope. The disc rapidly rotates about its own axis, and
    gravity causes a slower precession movement (shown as a dotted line) about a vertical axis.
    \label{gyroscope}}
\end{figure}

I set up initial conditions similar to the values one might find in a toy gyroscope (20
revolutions per second about the gyroscope axis, one full circle of precession in 8 seconds). I
then ran the simulation for 8~s, using an average time step length of about $2.3\cdot 10^{-4}$~s.
The simulation performed one full circle of precession in 7.953~s, which
is within 0.6~\% of the theoretical value. Over the course of 8~s, the body rotated by $320.36\pi$
radians about its own axis, which differs from the theoretical value by only 0.1~\%. These errors
varied little even in simulations using larger time steps. The effects of nutation\footnote{Having
nothing in common with \emph{mutation}, \emph{nutation} is an oscillation about an axis
orthogonal to the two main axes of rotation. \cite{Feynman:63}} were small for the chosen initial
conditions but may have contributed towards the errors.

It is interesting to also observe a different error, namely the amount by which the constraint
drifts apart. Usually this drift is compensated in the Lagrange multiplier method so that it
never manifests itself, but temporarily deactivating this
correction\footnote{by setting $k=d=0$ in equation~\ref{lagrangeEquation}.} makes the error
introduced by the ODE solver observable.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\input{figures/errorplot}}
\caption{Errors introduced by the ODE solver for different step sizes $h$, as observed in the
    gyroscope simulation.
    Solid line: difference between $O(h^4)$ and $O(h^5)$ Runge-Kutta approximations for each time
    step. Dashed line: cumulative drift of the gyroscope's `nail' constraint after 8~s simulation
    time.\label{errorplot}}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{errorplot} shows by what distance the gyroscope's `nail' constraint drifted apart
after 8~s of simulation time, for a wide range of different step sizes. There are some noteworthy
features about this plot:

\begin{itemize}
\item The logarithmic axes are scaled such that one order of magnitude in the horizontal has the
    same length as five orders of magnitude in the vertical. Observe that in this scaling, the
    solid line (error per time step) is an almost perfect straight line with gradient~1. This
    shows that the error is indeed an $O(h^5)$ function of the step size, as expected.
\item Over a wide range of step sizes, the plot of the total accumulated error is parallel to the
    solid line. This means the total error is also $O(h^5)$, which is even better than
    expected: although the approximation in each time step is $O(h^5)$, the number of steps
    required is inversely proportional to the step length, so one might expect a larger overall
    error. This relationship indicates that the ODE solver's target error can in fact be used
    as a reliable estimate of the overall error to within a constant factor.
\item As step sizes $h$ become very small~-- below about $3\cdot 10^{-4}$~s~-- the error in each
    step continues to scale order $O(h^5)$, but due to the huge number of steps, the accumulated
    error cannot be reduced much further. However, the errors here are in the range of nanometres,
    so they should be of little concern for computer graphics purposes.
\end{itemize}

In summary, the results for the simple gyroscope simulation inspire confidence that the
implementation is reliable and will continue to produce realistic results for complicated systems
which lack an exact solution. They also show that the target error can conveniently be adjusted
to match the requirements, because more CPU time does~-- within sensible bounds~-- buy higher
accuracy.


\subsection{Collision handling\label{evalCollisions}}

The analysis in the last section is relevant for continuous systems, but says nothing about
simulations involving collisions. For this purpose I simulated a different kind of physics toy,
\emph{Newton's cradle} (figure~\ref{cradleFigure}). This system does not have an exact analytical
solution, but it does have characteristic behaviour patterns which may be observed.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics{figures/cradle}}
\caption{Newton's cradle. By conservation of momentum and energy, if $k$ balls collide with one
    end of the chain of balls, the same number of balls bounce up on the opposite side. The other
    balls stay stationary.\label{cradleFigure}}
\end{figure}

Newton's cradle works best when the elasticity is large ($\varepsilon \approx 1$). I simulated
it using $\varepsilon = 1.0$ and $\varepsilon = 0.9$, with one ball initially raised and the other
four at rest. The comparison of the two simulation results is shown in figure~\ref{cradlePlots}.
The energy is calculated as the sum of potential, linear and angular kinetic energies of all five
balls, with zero potential when all balls are at their equilibrium position. Fully elastic
collisions conserve energy in the simulation (constant to within $1$ part in $10^8$), while
imperfect collisions instantaneously dissipate energy.

The momentum of balls 2--4 stays zero (within $1$ part in $10^{10}$, except for transient peaks,
which are immediately neutralized again) with full elasticity; with $\varepsilon = 0.9$, they
increasingly begin to swing, as expected. The bottommost plots in figure~\ref{cradlePlots}
show how the step size is reduced to find the exact time of collision, and large time steps
are taken otherwise.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\input{figures/cradle}}
\caption{Plot of various time-varying properties of Newton's cradle. Left column: using ideal,
    fully elastic collisions ($\varepsilon = 1.0$). Right column: imperfect collisions
    ($\varepsilon = 0.9$).\label{cradlePlots}}
\end{figure}

All behaviour exhibited by this system matches the behaviour observed in reality, so it
constitutes a good demonstration that the algorithm of section~\ref{collidingContact}
works correctly: it respects the constraints which attach the balls to the frame of Newton's
cradle, and it propagates impulses along the chain of contacts. The simulation works equally
well with more than one ball in motion.

\subsection{Run-time cost}

Profiling of the application revealed that the simulation spends about 93~\% of its time running
the biconjugate gradient algorithm to solve the constraint equations. To round off the quantitative
evaluation, I wanted to know how the computational cost relates to the size of the problem.

The biconjugate gradient algorithm is an iterative procedure which stops when some error
criterion is met. In theory, if exact arithmetic was being used, a solution would always be found
in $O(N)$ iterations for a system of $N$ constraints\footnote{or rigid bodies, but since we are
dealing with articulated bodies, we can assume a linear dependence between the numbers of bodies
and constraints.}~\cite{NRinC}. Each iteration requires a constant number of multiplications of a
matrix with a vector, and these multiplications dominate (86~\%) the cost of the algorithm. Such
a multiplication has a cost of $O(N^2)$ for a general matrix, but only
$O(N)$ for the type of sparse matrix we are dealing with. Hence a theoretical estimate of the
overall cost of the algorithm would be $O(N\cdot N) = O(N^2)$.

In practice, the algorithm converges more slowly when using floating-point arithmetic.
I measured the ratio of CPU time to simulation time for a range of different-sized systems and
found an overall relationship of about $O(N^{2.5})$. Note that the use of sparse matrices still
causes a significant benefit, since a simpler implementation would require the same number of
iterations and hence be about $O(N^{3.5})$. In absolute terms, a small simulation~-- of a
double pendulum, say~-- runs almost in real-time on my PC\footnote{AMD Athlon~XP~2000+},
while one with 100 constraints requires approximately one hour of CPU time per second of
simulation time.

\subsection{Numerical stability}

I had very few problems with numerical stability throughout this project. The ODE solving turned
out to be very robust; this is particularly satisfying since ODE stability would have been the
greatest problem if a penalty method had been used instead of Lagrange multipliers
(section~\ref{approachesToConstraints}). I occasionally observed divergence of the biconjugate
gradient algorithm; this seemed to occur only if there were contradictory constraints in the
system. In complicated collision geometries such contradictions did sometimes occur. I solved this
problem by keeping track of the approximate solution with the smallest error amongst all
iterations; if the algorithm starts diverging, it is aborted and the `best guess' is used.
This procedure is not mathematically justified, but in all my simulations it produced good results.

\section{Qualitative evaluation}

In the end, the purpose of this project is to produce animations for computer graphics, and the
last word must be given to the human observer who watches these animations. I would like to claim
that the results are of a quality similar to what an animator might create, and that they are
realistic in the sense that they do not violate the laws of physics or anatomy. However, such a
claim is difficult to defend convincingly in print. I have therefore compiled a video of several
example animations, and I urge the reader to watch it to gain a more personal impression of this
project's results. The video can be found on the CD-ROM accompanying this dissertation, and on the
project web site \texttt{http://www.maniation.com/}. Figures~\ref{sampleCradle}
to~\ref{sampleSpiral} give some frames from this video.

In the human character animation samples, the joints sometimes twist into positions which look
very uncomfortable. These positions do obey the joint limits which I prescribed to the simulation.
The simulation does not have any notion of ``comfort'' though; within the range of valid angles,
the joints move freely. The articulated body model would have to be extended to accommodate such
aspects.

Appendix~\ref{cdrom} gives further details on the implementation of these examples, and points
out noteworthy features.
